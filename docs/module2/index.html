      <p class = "title">Chicken</p>
      <p class = "body">First, browning promotes crispiness. There is nothing better than crispy roasted chicken skin, which you don’t normally get with traditional homemade chicken soup. Second, browning helps “lock” in all of the chicken juice, preventing it from drying out as it cooks. Third, as the chicken browns, it leaves browned bits on the bottom of the pot, which helps create an even more intensely flavored chicken stock for the soup.</p>

       <div>
      <p class = "title">Vegetable</p>
      <p class = "body">To make it in a crockpot saute onions, carrots, garlic for a few minutes, add garlic saute 1 minute longer. Add to slow cooker along with potatoes, tomatoes, green beans, potatoes, herbs, broth, salt and pepper. Cook until veggies are tender on high heat about 3 hours or low heat about 6 – 7 hours. Add peas and corn during the last 30 minutes.</p>

    <section class ="section3">
       <div>
      <p class = "title">Tomato</p>
      <p class = "body">Melt butter over medium heat in a Dutch oven or large saucepan. Add onion wedges, water, can of tomatoes with their juices, and 1/2 teaspoon of salt. Bring to a simmer. Cook, uncovered, for about 40 minutes. Stir occasionally and add additional salt as needed. Blend the soup, and then season to taste. The soup doesn’t need to be ultra-smooth, some texture is a nice touch. An immersion blender does make quick work of this, or you can use a blender. If you use a regular blender, it is best to blend in batches and not fill the blender as much as you usually would since the soup is so hot. We like to remove the center insert of the lid and cover it with a kitchen towel while blending — this helps to release some of the steam and prevents the blender lid from popping off.</p>
